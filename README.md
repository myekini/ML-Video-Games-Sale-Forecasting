- **Model Evaluation Metrics:**
  1. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 0.272
  2. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.215

  3. Sales plotted against the predicted ARIMA values.
  4. Plot of predicted mean and actual sales.

#### 4.2 SARIMAX Modeling
Building upon ARIMA, SARIMAX extends forecasting capabilities by incorporating exogenous variables. This section details model configuration and explores the impact of external factors on sales predictions.

- **Parameter Configuration:**
  - The SARIMAX model was configured with parameters `(0,1,1)` and seasonal order `(0,1,0,12)`. No exogenous variables were included.

- **Model Evaluation Metrics:**
  1. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 0.3738
  2. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.2233
  3. **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):** 388.98%

  1. Residuals plot.
  2. Combined plot of sales, predicted ARIMA, and SARIMAX values.

#### 4.3 fbProphet Modeling
Introducing the innovative fbProphet model, this section elucidates its application, configuration, and training methodology.

- **Model Configuration:**
  1. **Part 1:** The DataFrame was preprocessed to count occurrences of each genre per year.
  2. **Part 2:** The DataFrame was melted into long format for Prophet, and datetime conversion was performed.
  3. **Part 3:** Separate models were created and fitted for each genre using a loop.
  4. **Part 4:** Predictions were added to the dataset for the next 5 years.
